# Numerical analysis and Computation
---
These were written by me during my numerical analysis and computation class. The codes entails;
- How solve system of equations for both linear and non-linear system of equations
- For linear system of equations using different methods. 
   - Direct method: such as  forward and backward elimination method.  
   - Iterative method: Jacobi method	
- For the non-linear system of equations. There is the code for; secant method, newton raphson and etc.
- To find the solution of Partial differential equation using;
1. Finite difference method 
 * Forward difference approach 
 * Backward difference approach
2. Finite element method
